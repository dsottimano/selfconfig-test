# How Lanza works (architecture)

A short tour of what's under the hood — useful if you're maintaining the site, not
just editing it. Nothing here is needed for day-to-day writing.

## The big picture

Your site is two apps in one repository, plus a small bot:

- **`frontend/`** — the public website, built with **Astro**. Pure static HTML:
  every page is pre-rendered at build time, so there's no server to run and page
  views are free and fast. (Astro is pointed at this folder via `srcDir` in
  `astro.config.mjs`.)
- **`admin/`** — **Lanza**, this CMS. A Vue 3 + Vite single-page app that builds
  to `public/admin/` and is served at **`/admin`**. It has no backend of its own.
- **`bot/`** — an optional Telegram → draft-post Cloudflare Worker.

There is **no database and no application server**. The "database" is your Git
repository; the "server" is GitHub's API plus Cloudflare's static hosting.

## Where content lives

Everything you edit is plain text committed to the repo:

- **Posts, pages, taxonomies, authors** → markdown files under
  `frontend/content/…` (one subfolder per language for translated collections).
- **Site settings** (SEO defaults, menus, redirects) → JSON files under
  `frontend/data/…`.
- **Images** → committed under `public/images/uploads/` and served as static files.

Post and page **bodies are stored as HTML** (Lanza is the source of truth); the
content model — which collections exist and what fields they have — is defined in
one file, `admin/src/schema.ts`.

## Configuration is data too

The site's setup isn't hard-coded — it's committed JSON the CMS edits, read by both
the Astro front-end and the CMS:

- **`frontend/data/site.json`** — the **languages** (which locales exist + the
  default) and an `onboarded` flag. Written by the first-run wizard and by
  Settings → Languages. Astro reads it (`astro.config.mjs`, `frontend/lib/i18n.ts`)
  to build the right locale routes; the CMS reads it at boot for the language rail.
  Disabled locales are excluded from the build, so removing a language genuinely
  hides it (leftover content files are ignored, not published).
- **`frontend/data/appearance.json`** — the **theme**, optional **logo**, and the
  **brand** block (palette / corners / motion / fonts) from Settings → Brand.
  Written by the wizard and Settings → Brand; `Base.astro` turns the brand block
  into inline custom-property overrides (see `frontend/lib/appearance.ts`) that
  beat the active theme's tokens.

Because these are normal repo files written through the proxy, a change is just a
commit → a rebuild → live. The **first-run wizard** is simply the UI that writes
these files when `onboarded` isn't set yet; afterwards the same values are editable
under Settings.

## How saving works (the GitHub proxy)

When you save, Lanza calls the GitHub Contents API to commit the file. The
important part: **your GitHub token never lives in the browser.** Requests go to a
proxy at `/admin/api/gh/…`, which attaches the token on the server side and
forwards the call to GitHub:

- **In production:** a Cloudflare **Pages Function**
  (`functions/admin/api/gh/[[path]].ts`) injects the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret
  (configured in the Pages dashboard) and relays the request.
- **In development:** a Vite middleware in `admin/vite.config.ts` does the same,
  reading the token from `admin/.env` (never bundled into the app).

Either way the browser only ever talks to `/admin/api/gh` — the token stays out of
the page, the network tab, and the build output.

## Who can get in

`/admin` (and its proxy) sits behind a **"Sign in with GitHub"** gate — a small
Pages Function middleware (`functions/admin/_middleware.ts`). You log in with the
GitHub account that owns the site; a signed, HttpOnly session cookie keeps you in.
Only the login named in the `ADMIN_LOGIN` setting is allowed, so nobody else can
reach the CMS. Past that gate, the server-side token does the GitHub work — no
per-user token pasting required.

(This replaced Cloudflare Zero Trust, whose free tier demands a credit card during
setup — a non-starter for onboarding non-technical owners. See the Onboarding &
hosting doc for the full reasoning.)

## Publishing

1. You save in Lanza → a commit lands in the repo via the proxy.
2. Cloudflare Pages rebuilds: `npm run build` regenerates the CMS
   (`build:admin` → `public/admin`), compiles redirects, then runs the Astro
   build, which renders `frontend/` into static HTML in `dist/`.
3. The new static site goes live. Entries marked `draft: true` are dropped from
   the production build, so drafts never appear publicly.

## The bot (optional)

The Telegram Worker lets you fire off a quick draft from your phone. It commits a
`draft: true` markdown file to `frontend/content/posts/` through the same GitHub
API. Nothing it sends publishes automatically — you review and publish it here in
the CMS like any other draft.
